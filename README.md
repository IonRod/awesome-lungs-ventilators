List of open-source lungs ventilation projects 


# Desclimer
This list of open source medical ventilators is used to track homemade ventilators to prevent shortage of ventilators due to COVID-19 deseace. 

Please keep in mind, that these devices are not certified and in case of a deseace first of all contact authorities and doctors.

As many companies offer their services to produce medical ventilators, open source community can help to find a new and easy for a mass production design of a ventilator.

This project will keep the list of open source homemade medical ventilators to keep track of the progress of a DIY lung ventilators.

# Projects

- [Open Source Ventilator (OSV) Ireland](https://opensourceventilator.ie/) - OSV Ireland was formed by Colin Keogh, Conall Laverty & David Pollard, with the goal of building a focused team in Ireland to begin development of a Field Emergency Ventilator (FEV) in partnership with the Irish Health Service. To date we have formed a team of engineers, designers and medical practitioners to develop new, low resource interventions, all working collaboratively online. Bag Valve Masks (BVM), 3D printed and traditionally manufactured components are being considered to maximise potential manufacturing capabilities. We will also include other challenges and problems as they arise from frontline healthcare workers, which we will encourage our volunteers to tackle.

- [OpenLung BVM Ventilator](https://gitlab.com/open-source-ventilator/OpenLung) - An [IN PROGRESS] open source, low resource, quick deployment ventilator design that utilizes a bag valve mask (BVM or Ambu-bag) as a core component. An open collaboration with http://opensourceventilator.ie/.

- [https://www.projectopenair.org/](https://www.projectopenair.org/) - We are working on medical devices, to have a fast and easy solution that can be reproduced and assembled locally worldwide. 

- [https://www.gofundme.com/f/open-source-pandemic-ventilator](https://www.gofundme.com/f/open-source-pandemic-ventilator) - We are a team of engineers with backgrounds in nuclear power, submarine life support, medical device, quality assurance, and project management from Berkeley, Denver, and places around the world an emergency ventilator to address the looming shortage in the developing world.

Our efforts started when a doctor sent us a plan for a DIY ventilator. She knew her hospital was going to run out of ventilators as COVID 19 cases rose—leading to a situation where she would to choose who survives and who doesn't. This is a reality. This is happening today in Spain and Italy, soon in the US, and likely happen even harsher in the developing world.

- [The Pandemic Ventilator Project](https://www.instructables.com/id/The-Pandemic-Ventilator/) - Assembly instructions for a DIY Ventilator prototype.
This could be useful in an Avian Flu pandemic.
Constructed with commonly available components.

Many of us modify, hack, re-purpose, and DIY to save money, build something unique, create art, or show the world that there is a better way to use some device. And sometimes, just because it's cool. This is something different. It is a ventilator, and ventilators are meant to save lives. This project is called the Pandemic Ventilator, because it is meant to be used as a ventilator of last resort during a possible avian (bird) flu pandemic.

- [Low-Cost Open-Source Ventilator-ish Device or PAPR](https://github.com/jcl5m1/ventilator) - NOTE: This is currently an independent project not affiliated with any commercial institution.
In the event that COVID-19 hospitalizations exhaust the availability of FDA approved ventilators. This project documents the process of converting a low-cost CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure) blower into a rudimentary non-invasive pressure support ventilator that could help with breathing during respiratory distress.

This same project can also be used to create a reasonable low-cost Powered Air Purifying Respirator (PAPR) with filter adapter and mask. PAPRs are effective pieces of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) that could be helpful to caregivers. PAPRs will also be in extremely short supply and are much less risky and controversial than a DIY ventilator. You may be able to save many more lives by building a PAPR that protects a caregiver than a mediocre ventilator for one patient. Unless you are able to participate in the detailed engineering and medical discussions regarding mitigating the risks of high pressure ventilation, I would highly recommend focusing on the PAPR version of this build.

- [Specifications for simple open source mechanical ventilator](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FNPwrQjB1qW1330s5-S_-VB0vDHajMWKieJRjINCNeE/preview) - This is a living document intended to give non-clinicians/non-respiratory therapists an idea of key ventilator features and one proposed simplified design. I encourage other healthcare professionals who are very familiar with ventilators and their use to give me feedback using the comments feature to improve these specifications.
I’d like to thank those who have helped me improve this document.

- [Special Issue on Open-Source COVID19 Medical Hardware](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/hardwarex/call-for-papers/special-issue-on-open-source-covid19-medical-hardware) - Large groups of makers, engineers, and medical professionals are already collaborating on the web to make open source medical devices, such as ventilators, to have a fast and easy solution that can be reproduced and assembled locally worldwide. However, there is a concern in the medical community about using these devices without some assurance that these devices will operate as intended and not do harm. This special issue is dedicated to vetting the technical specifications and reproducibility of open medical hardware that can help during this global pandemic. Due to the urgency all articles will be rapidly peer-reviewed, published open access upon acceptance, and all article processing charges will be waived.
  
We are specifically looking for hardware that: 1) can be digitally manufactured using accessible low-cost fabrication tools like 3-D printers and 2) those that can be readily constructed from widely accessible materials and simple tools (e.g. DIY hardware store sourced).
