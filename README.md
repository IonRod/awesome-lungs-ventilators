List of open-source lungs ventilation projects 


# Desclimer
This list of open source medical ventilators is used to track homemade ventilators to prevent shortage of ventilators due to COVID-19 deseace. 

Please keep in mind, that these devices are not certified and in case of a deseace first of all contact authorities and doctors.

As many companies offer their services to produce medical ventilators, open source community can help to find a new and easy for a mass production design of a ventilator.

This project will keep the list of open source homemade medical ventilators to keep track of the progress of a DIY lung ventilators.

# Projects

- [Open Source Ventilator (OSV) Ireland](https://opensourceventilator.ie/) - OSV Ireland was formed by Colin Keogh, Conall Laverty & David Pollard, with the goal of building a focused team in Ireland to begin development of a Field Emergency Ventilator (FEV) in partnership with the Irish Health Service. To date we have formed a team of engineers, designers and medical practitioners to develop new, low resource interventions, all working collaboratively online. Bag Valve Masks (BVM), 3D printed and traditionally manufactured components are being considered to maximise potential manufacturing capabilities. We will also include other challenges and problems as they arise from frontline healthcare workers, which we will encourage our volunteers to tackle.

- [OpenLung BVM Ventilator](https://gitlab.com/open-source-ventilator/OpenLung) - An [IN PROGRESS] open source, low resource, quick deployment ventilator design that utilizes a bag valve mask (BVM or Ambu-bag) as a core component. An open collaboration with http://opensourceventilator.ie/.

- [https://www.projectopenair.org/](https://www.projectopenair.org/) - We are working on medical devices, to have a fast and easy solution that can be reproduced and assembled locally worldwide. 

- [Pandemic Ventilator](https://www.gofundme.com/f/open-source-pandemic-ventilator) - We are a team of engineers with backgrounds in nuclear power, submarine life support, medical device, quality assurance, and project management from Berkeley, Denver, and places around the world an emergency ventilator to address the looming shortage in the developing world.

- [The Pandemic Ventilator Project](https://www.instructables.com/id/The-Pandemic-Ventilator/) - Assembly instructions for a DIY Ventilator prototype. Many of us modify, hack, re-purpose, and DIY to save money, build something unique, create art, or show the world that there is a better way to use some device. And sometimes, just because it's cool. This is something different. It is a ventilator, and ventilators are meant to save lives. This project is called the Pandemic Ventilator, because it is meant to be used as a ventilator of last resort during a possible avian (bird) flu pandemic.

- [Low-Cost Open-Source Ventilator-ish Device or PAPR](https://github.com/jcl5m1/ventilator) - In the event that COVID-19 hospitalizations exhaust the availability of FDA approved ventilators. This project documents the process of converting a low-cost CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure) blower into a rudimentary non-invasive pressure support ventilator that could help with breathing during respiratory distress.
This same project can also be used to create a reasonable low-cost Powered Air Purifying Respirator (PAPR) with filter adapter and mask. PAPRs are effective pieces of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) that could be helpful to caregivers. PAPRs will also be in extremely short supply and are much less risky and controversial than a DIY ventilator. You may be able to save many more lives by building a PAPR that protects a caregiver than a mediocre ventilator for one patient. Unless you are able to participate in the detailed engineering and medical discussions regarding mitigating the risks of high pressure ventilation, I would highly recommend focusing on the PAPR version of this build. 

- [OxVent](https://oxvent.org/) - We are a team of Engineers, Clinicians & Manufacturers from @oxengsci @KingsCollegeLon @UniofOxford building a rapid prototype Ventilator for COVID-19. Join us!

- [VentilatorPAL](https://freebreathing.org/) - VentilatorPAL is a not-for-profit solution to the acute lack of respirators for the rapidly growing number of COVID-19 patients around the world.
VentilatorPAL is a high-quality but low-cost, open source ventilator that can be bought or built by anyone for a fraction of the cost of commercial ventilators.

- [VentilAid](https://www.ventilaid.org/) - We are a group of engineers and designers who constantly develop and share to the public the VentilAid project, open source ventilator, that can be made anywhere locally with 3D printer and very basic parts. Ventilators are essential to keep breathing when faced with the complications of COVID19.
We believe COVID19 pandemic will pass with minimized harm to mankind thanks to proper use of technology and solidarity in sharing knowledge.

- [MIT Emergency Ventilator (E-Vent) Project](https://e-vent.mit.edu/) - Key Research Question
We have launched an emergency research project with a team of MIT Engineers and American clinicians to address the question:

Providing Ventilation for Low Resource Settings

- [Ventilator by EBCore](https://www.ebcore.io/) - Unlike other ventilators the EVS is aimed at providing lifesaving ventilation for patients with COVID-19 and includes options to control the respiratory rate, tidal volume, PEEP, and Peak pressure relief.  There are no interactive real time graphics of pressure sensors.  There is a benefit in simplicity. 

- [A low oxygen consumption pneumatic ventilator for emergency construction during a respiratory failure pandemic](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2044.2009.06207.x) - The UK influenza pandemic plan predicts up to 750 000 additional deaths with hospitals prioritising patients against inadequate resources. We investigated three prototype low‐cost, gas‐efficient, pneumatic ventilators in a test lung model at different compliance and rate settings. Mean (SD) oxygen consumption was 0.913 (0.198) and 1.119 (0.267) l.min−1 at tidal volumes of 500 ml and 700 ml respectively. Values of FIo2 increased marginally as lung compliance reduced, reflecting the increased ventilator workload and consequent increased enrichment of breathing gas by waste oxygen from the pneumatic mechanism. We also demonstrated that a stable nitric oxide concentration could be delivered by this design following volumetric principles. It is possible to make a gas‐efficient ventilator costing less than £200 from industrial components for use where oxygen is available at 2‐4 bar, with no pressurised air or electrical requirements. Such a device could be mass‐produced for crises characterised by an overwhelming demand for mechanical ventilation and a limited oxygen supply.

- [Electric Blower Based Portable Emergency Ventilator](https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=1016&context=spacegrant&fbclid=IwAR1EtJVcxXm82PjGWFCA0t7H_MxNVjuseAePRfxNORr9h4ZQLQ9sNdQjXhc) - Abstract: During CPR the victim will most
likely be ventilated by a bag-valve-mask. We propose to replace the traditional bag-valvemask with an electric blower ventilator. This handheld feedback controlled device will automatically compensate for mask leak and enable the rescuer to deliver computer controlled respiratory rates and tidal volumes. We will build a working prototype and conduct bench testing to verify that the blower delivers the desired tidal volumes, even with constantly changing leak conditions that exist when a mask that is poorly fit to a victim’s face. In a volunteer study we will observe how typical rescuers use the blower ventilator so we can develop a product that can be easily and correctly used by naïve rescuers. We will conduct human trials in the operating room to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the blower ventilator.

- [Special Issue on Open-Source COVID19 Medical Hardware](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/hardwarex/call-for-papers/special-issue-on-open-source-covid19-medical-hardware) - Large groups of makers, engineers, and medical professionals are already collaborating on the web to make open source medical devices, such as ventilators, to have a fast and easy solution that can be reproduced and assembled locally worldwide. However, there is a concern in the medical community about using these devices without some assurance that these devices will operate as intended and not do harm. This special issue is dedicated to vetting the technical specifications and reproducibility of open medical hardware that can help during this global pandemic. Due to the urgency all articles will be rapidly peer-reviewed, published open access upon acceptance, and all article processing charges will be waived.
  
We are specifically looking for hardware that: 1) can be digitally manufactured using accessible low-cost fabrication tools like 3-D printers and 2) those that can be readily constructed from widely accessible materials and simple tools (e.g. DIY hardware store sourced).
